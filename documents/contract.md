# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet approximately 1-2 times per week, with a weekly meeting at 6pm on Wednesdays with the possibility of an additional meeting if required. The meetings will last approximately 1 hour. We plan to meet in person at 112 E Green (Avik's apartment) or Zoom if needed. If someone cannot make the meeting due to external circumstances (work, test, etc.) we will move the meeting to a better time. Keegan will take notes on the meeting.

2. **Assistance** 
We will primarily contact each other via text, we already have a group chat formed. The weekly meetings will also act as a form of contact. If a team member needs immediate assistance, they can do a group call in the iMessage. If the assistance is not as pressing, they can text in the group chat. All other group members should respond within a reasonable time frame.

3. **Respect** 
We all respect one another as students and as programmers. At each meeting, we will have an open discussion of ideas, with no infighting or conflicts. Each idea will be voted on and without a consensus, we will not move forward.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
After deciding on the full scope of the project, we will divide work evenly based on strengths and weaknesses. There is data organization, graph creation, algorithmic design, and UI/packaging. We can each work on a part, reporting back on our progress throughout the week. Pushes to the github must 

5. **Time Commitment** 
We expect each team member to contribute 3-4 hours of work per week. However, if it takes significantly less/more time for a component of the project, we can agree to adjust workload together. When time commitments/conflicts occur, we will work together to redistribute work to make sure that everyone has a fair share.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We all respect the course and our group project, and hopefully no conflicts will occur. However, if an issue or disagreement forms between members of the group, we will take the time to resolve it during the weekly meetings. If a team member is not completing their tasks or is not attending meetings, we will contact them directly to ask about the circumstances. If not resolved, we will contact course staff.
